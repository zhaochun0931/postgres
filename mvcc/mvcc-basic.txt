Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) 


MVCC is how Postgres handles concurrent transactions without locking everything. Instead of overwriting rows, it keeps multiple versions of each row.




Tuple Structure

Each row in a table (a heap tuple) has hidden system columns:

xmin → Transaction ID that created the row.

xmax → Transaction ID that deleted/updated the row (if any).

ctid → Physical location of the tuple (used for HOT updates).

t_xmin_commit / t_xmin_aborted flags → whether the creating transaction committed or aborted.
