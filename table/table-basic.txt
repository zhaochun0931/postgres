In PostgreSQL, a table is stored physically on disk as a heap file within a directory structure organized by databases and tablespaces. 

The data is not stored as a single, contiguous file, but is divided into fixed-size pages, and tables larger than 1 GB are split into multiple files called segments.






To check the location of the table file on disk

SELECT pg_relation_filepath('your_table_name');


testdb=# SELECT pg_relation_filepath('t1');
 pg_relation_filepath
----------------------
 base/16384/16389
(1 row)

testdb=#






To check the storage size of a table

SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('your_table_name'));



SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('t1'));

testdb=# SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('t1'));
 pg_size_pretty
----------------
 2075 MB
(1 row)

testdb=#
