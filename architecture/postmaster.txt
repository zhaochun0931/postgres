In PostgreSQL, the postmaster is the main PostgreSQL server process â€” the "parent" daemon that starts when you run postgres (or the wrapper pg_ctl start)







Startup & Initialization



When you start PostgreSQL, the postmaster initializes shared memory, semaphores, and other resources needed by the database system.

Process Manager
It forks and manages child processes


Connection Handling
The postmaster listens for incoming connections (TCP/IP or Unix socket). When a client connects, it forks a backend process (postgres process) dedicated to serving that client.

Crash Recovery
If a backend crashes, postmaster detects it, logs the failure, and can initiate crash recovery using WAL (Write-Ahead Log).

PID File (postmaster.pid)
It writes its process ID to $PGDATA/postmaster.pid, which is used to prevent multiple instances from starting in the same data directory.

ðŸ‘‰ Historically, the executable was called postmaster. Nowadays, the binary is just postgres






PostgreSQL writes the postmasterâ€™s PID into a file:

cat $PGDATA/postmaster.pid


The first line is the postmaster PID.
