In PostgreSQL (pg), a foreign table is a database object that represents a table residing on an external data source. It allows you to query, and in some cases modify, data in a remote database or even a different type of data source as if it were a local table. 

Foreign tables rely on a component called a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW), which is a specialized library that handles the connection and communication with the external data source. 





Key concepts
To create and use a foreign table, you need to set up three main components:

Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW): 
This is the extension that provides the functionality to connect to a specific type of external data source. For example, the built-in postgres_fdw is used to connect to another PostgreSQL server.

Foreign Server: 
This object defines the connection details for the external data source, such as its host address, port, and database name. It is created using the CREATE SERVER command.
  
User Mapping: 
This defines the authentication credentials (username and password) that a local PostgreSQL user will use to connect to the remote server. It is created with the CREATE USER MAPPING command.
