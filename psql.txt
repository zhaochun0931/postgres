By default, psql without parameters does:

psql
# same as
psql -U $USER -d $USER


So if your Linux user is root, it tries to connect as Postgres role root.

In your setup, the only user you created is admin (via POSTGRES_USER=admin), so root or postgres doesn’t exist in the database.

That’s why you see:

pg-server  | 2025-10-10 13:51:30.149 GMT [223] FATAL:  role "root" does not exist
pg-server  | 2025-10-10 13:52:04.064 GMT [233] FATAL:  role "postgres" does not exist
pg-server  | 2025-10-10 13:52:26.580 GMT [236] FATAL:  role "postgres" does not exist
