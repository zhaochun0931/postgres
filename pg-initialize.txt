- initialize a database (initdb command)
- start up a database


1. Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage area on disk. We call this a database cluster.
After initialization, a database cluster will contain a database named postgres. There are two more databases created within each cluster during initialization, named template1 and template0.

In file system terms, a database cluster is a single directory under which all data will be stored. We call this the data directory or data area. 






After initialization, three databases should be created automatically. 
- postgres
- template0
- template1





To initialize a database cluster manually, run initdb and specify the desired file system location of the database cluster with the -D option. There is no default, although locations such as /usr/local/pgsql/data or /var/lib/pgsql/data are popular.


initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data




Alternatively, you can run initdb via the pg_ctl program like so:

pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data initdb





2. Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database server. The database server program is called postgres. 

The bare-bones way to start the server manually is just to invoke postgres directly, specifying the location of the data directory with the -D option, for example:

postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &




$ postgres -D /data1

2025-03-04 13:56:18.235 UTC [45968] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections







While the server is running, its PID is stored in the file postmaster.pid in the data directory. This is used to prevent multiple server instances from running in the same data directory and can also be used for shutting down the server.

template0 should never be modified, but you can add objects to template1, which by default will be copied into databases created later
