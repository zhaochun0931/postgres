The PostgreSQL optimizer (often called the query planner/optimizer) is the brain that decides how your SQL query will actually be executed.



ðŸ”¹ Purpose of the PostgreSQL Optimizer

Translate SQL into a plan

  SQL is declarative: you describe what you want, not how to get it.
  
  The optimizer figures out the execution plan (the "how").


Choose the most efficient execution strategy

PostgreSQL may consider different ways to run your query:

Sequential scan vs. Index scan vs. Bitmap scan

Nested loop join vs. Hash join vs. Merge join

Aggregation strategies (e.g., hash aggregate vs. sort + group)

The optimizer estimates the cost of each strategy and picks the cheapest one.


Balance I/O, CPU, and memory usage

  Cost models weigh factors like disk reads, CPU cycles, available memory, parallel workers.
  
  Example: If a table is small, a sequential scan may be faster than using an index.


Support scalability

  For large queries (data warehouses, analytics), the optimizer ensures queries finish in seconds instead of hours.
  
  Parallel query execution is also decided here.
