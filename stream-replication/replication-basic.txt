The primary mechanism that PostgreSQL uses to provide a data durability guarantee is through its Write Ahead Log (WAL). 
All transactional data is written to this location before ever being committed to database files. 
Once WAL files are no longer necessary for crash recovery, PostgreSQL will either delete or archive them.




Determine Your Replication Setup


Decide whether you are setting up:
- Streaming replication (common for real-time replication).
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) using WAL files from an archive.



If Setting Up Streaming Replication
Ensure the recovery.signal File Exists
The recovery.signal file enables standby mode. Without this file, PostgreSQL expects a restore_command.




If Using WAL Archiving (PITR)
Set restore_command in postgresql.conf
A restore_command specifies how to fetch archived WAL files. For example:
restore_command = 'cp /path/to/wal_archive/%f %p'

Replace /path/to/wal_archive with the location of your archived WAL files.

Remove the recovery.signal File





archive_mode
we enable archive_mode by setting it to on. With archive mode enabled, we can specify a command that will execute when PostgreSQL no longer needs a WAL file for crash recovery.
In the archive_command setting, the %p value represents the full path to the WAL file, and %f resolves to the filename
